No one likes to think of his or her child being injured or ill. But the fact is, every year more than 3 million children in the U.S. are hospitalized for illnesses and accidents. An estimated 600,000 children are hospitalized annually due to injuries alone, such as play injuries, car accidents or domestic violence. And asthma, the number one illness in children under age 14, hospitalizes more than 100,000 children annually. \"Probably the most important thing a parent can do to maximize a good medical outcome and minimize the traumatic effect of a childhood hospital experience is to take a few preparatory steps,\" says David G. Zipes, MD, a full-time pediatric hospitalist, medical director of St. Vincent Pediatric Hospitalists and a Board Member of the National Association of Inpatient Physicians (NAIP). \"First of all, parents should explain to their children early on what a hospital is,\" says Zipes, \"That way, if their child ever faces an emergency admission, they already have a basic understanding that a hospital is, simply put, a place where people go to get well.\" Second, parents need to keep accurate, up-to-date records of a child's growth, past illnesses or injuries, allergies and immunizations. \"Keeping good records is increasingly important in today's transient society, where a child may not grow up with one family physician,\" says Zipes. \"Organized records not only assist doctors, they help other caregivers act appropriately in difficult situations.\"In non-emergent care admissions, there are a number of additional steps parents can take to help minimize a child's fear of the hospital. These include the following: Talk to the child about why he is going into the hospital, how long he might stay and what is going to happen there. \"Make sure your child understands that there may be lots of different people coming into the room to take care of him,\" says Zipes. \"Explain what a nurse does and that a nurse may come in during the middle of the night and wake him up to take his temperature or give him a pill. Otherwise, the experience of being awakened by a stranger in the middle of the night can be very traumatic.\" \"Be honest with your child about blood tests, IVs and other medical procedures,\" says Zipes. \"If it will hurt, say that it will hurt, but that it won't hurt for long, or won't hurt too badly. It's inappropriate to say a painful procedure won't hurt at all. If you do, and it does hurt, you'll lose your child's trust and make the child even more fearful of the simple procedures that really don't hurt, like an x-ray. There are topical medicines available that can be used to reduce the pain of needle sticks,\" Zipes says, \"Ask your doctor if this can be used for your child.\" Zipes also recommends that parents be in the room, if possible, but discourages parental participation in holding or restraining the child. \"Parents should be there for comfort,\" explains Zipes. If your child won't be admitted for a few days, call the hospital and ask if you can arrange to bring your child in to \"visit\" the hospital ahead of time, to familiarize her with the environment. Walk her around and show her a room, explain the nurse's role and let her absorb the atmosphere. By eliminating the mystery, you can, in many cases, reduce the child's fear. Stay with your child as much as possible, especially during the first 24 hours after admission. If you can't be in the hospital with your child, arrange to have someone there whom your child knows. Arrange for siblings, if possible, to visit. Bring your child's favorite toy, stuffed animal, blanket or book to the hospital. Familiar objects can provide comfort and distractions from thesurroundings or procedures. Ask if your hospital has child life specialists. Child life specialists are specially trained to minimize the discomfort of the hospital stay. Try to control your own emotions. Remember that your child can sense when you're upset. Zipes says children can read a lot from their parents' emotional state. If your facial expression and tone reveal distress or fear, then it's likely your child will be fearful. Reassure your child that he's in the hospital to get well. Some children view the hospital as punishment and need reassurance they're not there because they did something bad. Don't forget to include the child's siblings in discussions about the hospital. It can be equally frightening for children who see their brother or sister in the hospital, especially if the ill child is agitated. Make sure the siblings know that their brother or sister is in the hospital to make them feel better, not as punishment. Also, make sure they know that no one is to blame. Children can feel responsible for situations they don't understand. After discharge, follow up with your child's feelings. Just because your child is no longer in the hospital doesn't mean he or she has gotten over or forgotten the experience. Just as there are physical aspects of healing, there may be psychological aspects as well. Talk with her about the overall experience. If she has ongoing fears, visit a child therapist that may be able to help the child overcome these fears. Don't be surprised if your child has some transient regression in their development. For instance, children recently toilet trained may start to have accidents again. Be loving, sensitive and caring. \"This may be one of the most important times for a parent to express their love and admiration for their child,\" says Zipes. \"A positive, loving attitude can go a long way toward making a child feel more comfortable and accepting of an uncomfortable situation.\" To find out more, contact the National Association of Inpatient Physicians at 1-800-843-3360 or visit our web site at www.naiponline.com.","date":"12-14-2015","status":"great!"}]}]

According to NAIP President Ron Angus, M.D., advance preparation for a hospital stay could make the difference in having a positive experience with a good outcome, or having a bad experience with a potentially negative outcome. Dr. Angus suggests: 1. Make sure your hospital has JCAHO accreditation and a good reputation in the community. Ask your doctor if your hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. The JCAHO is an independent, not-for-profit organization that evaluates and accredits almost 20,000 healthcare companies and programs that meet national health and safety standards. The JCAHO conducts on-site surveys of the hospital s medical care, nursing care, safety, pharmacy services, special-care units and more. If possible, also speak with others who have been treated at your hospital to get first-hand knowledge about the care provided there. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 2 2. Find out if the facility is experienced in treating your particular medical problem. Hospitals and physicians who perform a higher volume of a particular procedure achieve what is called  best practices,  which leads to more positive medical outcomes than those with lesser experience and lower volume. 3. Understand what part of your treatment and hospital care will be covered by insurance. Avoid last-minute surprises from your insurer. Speak with an insurance representative to make certain they don t require a second opinion from another doctor before authorizing your medical stay. Find out the total estimated cost of the care and how much you will pay out of pocket. Ask whether you will have to make an initial payment up front and what payment arrangements can be made. 4. Ask your doctor how long will you be hospitalized, how long your recovery will take, and whether a discharge plan will be prepared for you so you can continue care at home if needed. Information is your biggest asset. The more you communicate with your healthcare team, the better prepared you ll be to handle anything that happens. 5. Find out who will be treating you in the hospital   your primary care doctor or a hospital specialist? More and more primary care physicians are referring their hospitalized patients to acute-care specialists while in the hospital. These specialists, called hospitalists, are physicians who focus on the care of hospitalized patients and on trying to make the hospital system work better for patients. Hospitalists keep your primary care physician up to date on your treatment and progress, so your care can be transferred back to your primary doctor once you are discharged without any loss of important information. Hospitalists also work closely with other members of your treatment team, including surgeons, radiologists, anesthesiologists or cardiologists, depending on your diagnosis and treatment needs. While each of these and other specialists may play important roles in your hospital care, having a hospitalist ensures that a single doctor will help organize and orchestrate your care throughout your hospitalization. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 3 6. Select a family member or friend who can be your advocate while you are hospitalized. Choose an advocate who is informed of your wishes and aware of any Advance Directives you may have provided to other family members, your doctor or the hospital. Introduce your advocate to your physician. This will assure that your wishes are carried out, should unexpected circumstances arise to which you cannot respond. 7. Prepare ahead for special family needs or personal support. Hospitalization can create crisis within a family depending on the severity of illness, length of stay, recovery, and the family situation. Children in single-parent homes may need a caretaker. Families on tight budgets may need financial support. Patients with life-changing illnesses may need emotional or spiritual support. Ask if your hospital has social workers, flexible financing arrangements, and counselors/clergy for your personal support. Will you need assistance when you are at home recovering? Many community organizations and home health services provide short-term assistance for patients needing home nursing therapy, meal preparation, transportation or help with personal hygiene. 8. Prepare for your hospital stay. Find out when to arrive, what you should bring with you and what instructions your doctor has regarding eating and drinking prior to admission. Ask about visiting hours and what times meals are served. Bring something to entertain you while you rest: reading materials, playing cards, crossword puzzles, etc. 9. Stay informed throughout the course of your treatment. Be familiar with your chart and know what medications you are taking, how often and why. Ask what medications your attending nurse is giving before you take them; don t take medications that haven t properly been explained to you, and don t sign papers you don t understand. Whenever you have questions, ask them, and make sure you get an answer that s clear. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 4 10. Follow your doctor s recovery recommendations. Don t shortchange yourself after you re discharged. Follow your doctor s recommendations. It s not uncommon for people who don t finish their prescribed medications, or don t stay in bed long enough, to end up back in the hospital.

No one likes to think of his or her child being injured or ill. But the fact is, every year more than 3 million children in the U.S. are hospitalized for illnesses and accidents. An estimated 600,000 children are hospitalized annually due to injuries alone, such as play injuries, car accidents or domestic violence. And asthma, the number one illness in children under age 14, hospitalizes more than 100,000 children annually. \"Probably the most important thing a parent can do to maximize a good medical outcome and minimize the traumatic effect of a childhood hospital experience is to take a few preparatory steps,\" says David G. Zipes, MD, a full-time pediatric hospitalist, medical director of St. Vincent Pediatric Hospitalists and a Board Member of the National Association of Inpatient Physicians (NAIP). \"First of all, parents should explain to their children early on what a hospital is,\" says Zipes, \"That way, if their child ever faces an emergency admission, they already have a basic understanding that a hospital is, simply put, a place where people go to get well.\" Second, parents need to keep accurate, up-to-date records of a child's growth, past illnesses or injuries, allergies and immunizations. \"Keeping good records is increasingly important in today's transient society, where a child may not grow up with one family physician,\" says Zipes. \"Organized records not only assist doctors, they help other caregivers act appropriately in difficult situations.\"In non-emergent care admissions, there are a number of additional steps parents can take to help minimize a child's fear of the hospital. These include the following: Talk to the child about why he is going into the hospital, how long he might stay and what is going to happen there. \"Make sure your child understands that there may be lots of different people coming into the room to take care of him,\" says Zipes. \"Explain what a nurse does and that a nurse may come in during the middle of the night and wake him up to take his temperature or give him a pill. Otherwise, the experience of being awakened by a stranger in the middle of the night can be very traumatic.\" \"Be honest with your child about blood tests, IVs and other medical procedures,\" says Zipes. \"If it will hurt, say that it will hurt, but that it won't hurt for long, or won't hurt too badly. It's inappropriate to say a painful procedure won't hurt at all. If you do, and it does hurt, you'll lose your child's trust and make the child even more fearful of the simple procedures that really don't hurt, like an x-ray. There are topical medicines available that can be used to reduce the pain of needle sticks,\" Zipes says, \"Ask your doctor if this can be used for your child.\" Zipes also recommends that parents be in the room, if possible, but discourages parental participation in holding or restraining the child. \"Parents should be there for comfort,\" explains Zipes. If your child won't be admitted for a few days, call the hospital and ask if you can arrange to bring your child in to \"visit\" the hospital ahead of time, to familiarize her with the environment. Walk her around and show her a room, explain the nurse's role and let her absorb the atmosphere. By eliminating the mystery, you can, in many cases, reduce the child's fear. Stay with your child as much as possible, especially during the first 24 hours after admission. If you can't be in the hospital with your child, arrange to have someone there whom your child knows. Arrange for siblings, if possible, to visit. Bring your child's favorite toy, stuffed animal, blanket or book to the hospital. Familiar objects can provide comfort and distractions from thesurroundings or procedures. Ask if your hospital has child life specialists. Child life specialists are specially trained to minimize the discomfort of the hospital stay. Try to control your own emotions. Remember that your child can sense when you're upset. Zipes says children can read a lot from their parents' emotional state. If your facial expression and tone reveal distress or fear, then it's likely your child will be fearful. Reassure your child that he's in the hospital to get well. Some children view the hospital as punishment and need reassurance they're not there because they did something bad. Don't forget to include the child's siblings in discussions about the hospital. It can be equally frightening for children who see their brother or sister in the hospital, especially if the ill child is agitated. Make sure the siblings know that their brother or sister is in the hospital to make them feel better, not as punishment. Also, make sure they know that no one is to blame. Children can feel responsible for situations they don't understand. After discharge, follow up with your child's feelings. Just because your child is no longer in the hospital doesn't mean he or she has gotten over or forgotten the experience. Just as there are physical aspects of healing, there may be psychological aspects as well. Talk with her about the overall experience. If she has ongoing fears, visit a child therapist that may be able to help the child overcome these fears. Don't be surprised if your child has some transient regression in their development. For instance, children recently toilet trained may start to have accidents again. Be loving, sensitive and caring. \"This may be one of the most important times for a parent to express their love and admiration for their child,\" says Zipes. \"A positive, loving attitude can go a long way toward making a child feel more comfortable and accepting of an uncomfortable situation.\" To find out more, contact the National Association of Inpatient Physicians at 1-800-843-3360 or visit our web site at www.naiponline.com.","date":"12-14-2015","status":"great!"}]}]

According to NAIP President Ron Angus, M.D., advance preparation for a hospital stay could make the difference in having a positive experience with a good outcome, or having a bad experience with a potentially negative outcome. Dr. Angus suggests: 1. Make sure your hospital has JCAHO accreditation and a good reputation in the community. Ask your doctor if your hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. The JCAHO is an independent, not-for-profit organization that evaluates and accredits almost 20,000 healthcare companies and programs that meet national health and safety standards. The JCAHO conducts on-site surveys of the hospital s medical care, nursing care, safety, pharmacy services, special-care units and more. If possible, also speak with others who have been treated at your hospital to get first-hand knowledge about the care provided there. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 2 2. Find out if the facility is experienced in treating your particular medical problem. Hospitals and physicians who perform a higher volume of a particular procedure achieve what is called  best practices,  which leads to more positive medical outcomes than those with lesser experience and lower volume. 3. Understand what part of your treatment and hospital care will be covered by insurance. Avoid last-minute surprises from your insurer. Speak with an insurance representative to make certain they don t require a second opinion from another doctor before authorizing your medical stay. Find out the total estimated cost of the care and how much you will pay out of pocket. Ask whether you will have to make an initial payment up front and what payment arrangements can be made. 4. Ask your doctor how long will you be hospitalized, how long your recovery will take, and whether a discharge plan will be prepared for you so you can continue care at home if needed. Information is your biggest asset. The more you communicate with your healthcare team, the better prepared you ll be to handle anything that happens. 5. Find out who will be treating you in the hospital   your primary care doctor or a hospital specialist? More and more primary care physicians are referring their hospitalized patients to acute-care specialists while in the hospital. These specialists, called hospitalists, are physicians who focus on the care of hospitalized patients and on trying to make the hospital system work better for patients. Hospitalists keep your primary care physician up to date on your treatment and progress, so your care can be transferred back to your primary doctor once you are discharged without any loss of important information. Hospitalists also work closely with other members of your treatment team, including surgeons, radiologists, anesthesiologists or cardiologists, depending on your diagnosis and treatment needs. While each of these and other specialists may play important roles in your hospital care, having a hospitalist ensures that a single doctor will help organize and orchestrate your care throughout your hospitalization. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 3 6. Select a family member or friend who can be your advocate while you are hospitalized. Choose an advocate who is informed of your wishes and aware of any Advance Directives you may have provided to other family members, your doctor or the hospital. Introduce your advocate to your physician. This will assure that your wishes are carried out, should unexpected circumstances arise to which you cannot respond. 7. Prepare ahead for special family needs or personal support. Hospitalization can create crisis within a family depending on the severity of illness, length of stay, recovery, and the family situation. Children in single-parent homes may need a caretaker. Families on tight budgets may need financial support. Patients with life-changing illnesses may need emotional or spiritual support. Ask if your hospital has social workers, flexible financing arrangements, and counselors/clergy for your personal support. Will you need assistance when you are at home recovering? Many community organizations and home health services provide short-term assistance for patients needing home nursing therapy, meal preparation, transportation or help with personal hygiene. 8. Prepare for your hospital stay. Find out when to arrive, what you should bring with you and what instructions your doctor has regarding eating and drinking prior to admission. Ask about visiting hours and what times meals are served. Bring something to entertain you while you rest: reading materials, playing cards, crossword puzzles, etc. 9. Stay informed throughout the course of your treatment. Be familiar with your chart and know what medications you are taking, how often and why. Ask what medications your attending nurse is giving before you take them; don t take medications that haven t properly been explained to you, and don t sign papers you don t understand. Whenever you have questions, ask them, and make sure you get an answer that s clear. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 4 10. Follow your doctor s recovery recommendations. Don t shortchange yourself after you re discharged. Follow your doctor s recommendations. It s not uncommon for people who don t finish their prescribed medications, or don t stay in bed long enough, to end up back in the hospital.

No one likes to think of his or her child being injured or ill. But the fact is, every year more than 3 million children in the U.S. are hospitalized for illnesses and accidents. An estimated 600,000 children are hospitalized annually due to injuries alone, such as play injuries, car accidents or domestic violence. And asthma, the number one illness in children under age 14, hospitalizes more than 100,000 children annually. \"Probably the most important thing a parent can do to maximize a good medical outcome and minimize the traumatic effect of a childhood hospital experience is to take a few preparatory steps,\" says David G. Zipes, MD, a full-time pediatric hospitalist, medical director of St. Vincent Pediatric Hospitalists and a Board Member of the National Association of Inpatient Physicians (NAIP). \"First of all, parents should explain to their children early on what a hospital is,\" says Zipes, \"That way, if their child ever faces an emergency admission, they already have a basic understanding that a hospital is, simply put, a place where people go to get well.\" Second, parents need to keep accurate, up-to-date records of a child's growth, past illnesses or injuries, allergies and immunizations. \"Keeping good records is increasingly important in today's transient society, where a child may not grow up with one family physician,\" says Zipes. \"Organized records not only assist doctors, they help other caregivers act appropriately in difficult situations.\"In non-emergent care admissions, there are a number of additional steps parents can take to help minimize a child's fear of the hospital. These include the following: Talk to the child about why he is going into the hospital, how long he might stay and what is going to happen there. \"Make sure your child understands that there may be lots of different people coming into the room to take care of him,\" says Zipes. \"Explain what a nurse does and that a nurse may come in during the middle of the night and wake him up to take his temperature or give him a pill. Otherwise, the experience of being awakened by a stranger in the middle of the night can be very traumatic.\" \"Be honest with your child about blood tests, IVs and other medical procedures,\" says Zipes. \"If it will hurt, say that it will hurt, but that it won't hurt for long, or won't hurt too badly. It's inappropriate to say a painful procedure won't hurt at all. If you do, and it does hurt, you'll lose your child's trust and make the child even more fearful of the simple procedures that really don't hurt, like an x-ray. There are topical medicines available that can be used to reduce the pain of needle sticks,\" Zipes says, \"Ask your doctor if this can be used for your child.\" Zipes also recommends that parents be in the room, if possible, but discourages parental participation in holding or restraining the child. \"Parents should be there for comfort,\" explains Zipes. If your child won't be admitted for a few days, call the hospital and ask if you can arrange to bring your child in to \"visit\" the hospital ahead of time, to familiarize her with the environment. Walk her around and show her a room, explain the nurse's role and let her absorb the atmosphere. By eliminating the mystery, you can, in many cases, reduce the child's fear. Stay with your child as much as possible, especially during the first 24 hours after admission. If you can't be in the hospital with your child, arrange to have someone there whom your child knows. Arrange for siblings, if possible, to visit. Bring your child's favorite toy, stuffed animal, blanket or book to the hospital. Familiar objects can provide comfort and distractions from thesurroundings or procedures. Ask if your hospital has child life specialists. Child life specialists are specially trained to minimize the discomfort of the hospital stay. Try to control your own emotions. Remember that your child can sense when you're upset. Zipes says children can read a lot from their parents' emotional state. If your facial expression and tone reveal distress or fear, then it's likely your child will be fearful. Reassure your child that he's in the hospital to get well. Some children view the hospital as punishment and need reassurance they're not there because they did something bad. Don't forget to include the child's siblings in discussions about the hospital. It can be equally frightening for children who see their brother or sister in the hospital, especially if the ill child is agitated. Make sure the siblings know that their brother or sister is in the hospital to make them feel better, not as punishment. Also, make sure they know that no one is to blame. Children can feel responsible for situations they don't understand. After discharge, follow up with your child's feelings. Just because your child is no longer in the hospital doesn't mean he or she has gotten over or forgotten the experience. Just as there are physical aspects of healing, there may be psychological aspects as well. Talk with her about the overall experience. If she has ongoing fears, visit a child therapist that may be able to help the child overcome these fears. Don't be surprised if your child has some transient regression in their development. For instance, children recently toilet trained may start to have accidents again. Be loving, sensitive and caring. \"This may be one of the most important times for a parent to express their love and admiration for their child,\" says Zipes. \"A positive, loving attitude can go a long way toward making a child feel more comfortable and accepting of an uncomfortable situation.\" To find out more, contact the National Association of Inpatient Physicians at 1-800-843-3360 or visit our web site at www.naiponline.com.","date":"12-14-2015","status":"great!"}]}]

According to NAIP President Ron Angus, M.D., advance preparation for a hospital stay could make the difference in having a positive experience with a good outcome, or having a bad experience with a potentially negative outcome. Dr. Angus suggests: 1. Make sure your hospital has JCAHO accreditation and a good reputation in the community. Ask your doctor if your hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. The JCAHO is an independent, not-for-profit organization that evaluates and accredits almost 20,000 healthcare companies and programs that meet national health and safety standards. The JCAHO conducts on-site surveys of the hospital s medical care, nursing care, safety, pharmacy services, special-care units and more. If possible, also speak with others who have been treated at your hospital to get first-hand knowledge about the care provided there. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 2 2. Find out if the facility is experienced in treating your particular medical problem. Hospitals and physicians who perform a higher volume of a particular procedure achieve what is called  best practices,  which leads to more positive medical outcomes than those with lesser experience and lower volume. 3. Understand what part of your treatment and hospital care will be covered by insurance. Avoid last-minute surprises from your insurer. Speak with an insurance representative to make certain they don t require a second opinion from another doctor before authorizing your medical stay. Find out the total estimated cost of the care and how much you will pay out of pocket. Ask whether you will have to make an initial payment up front and what payment arrangements can be made. 4. Ask your doctor how long will you be hospitalized, how long your recovery will take, and whether a discharge plan will be prepared for you so you can continue care at home if needed. Information is your biggest asset. The more you communicate with your healthcare team, the better prepared you ll be to handle anything that happens. 5. Find out who will be treating you in the hospital   your primary care doctor or a hospital specialist? More and more primary care physicians are referring their hospitalized patients to acute-care specialists while in the hospital. These specialists, called hospitalists, are physicians who focus on the care of hospitalized patients and on trying to make the hospital system work better for patients. Hospitalists keep your primary care physician up to date on your treatment and progress, so your care can be transferred back to your primary doctor once you are discharged without any loss of important information. Hospitalists also work closely with other members of your treatment team, including surgeons, radiologists, anesthesiologists or cardiologists, depending on your diagnosis and treatment needs. While each of these and other specialists may play important roles in your hospital care, having a hospitalist ensures that a single doctor will help organize and orchestrate your care throughout your hospitalization. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 3 6. Select a family member or friend who can be your advocate while you are hospitalized. Choose an advocate who is informed of your wishes and aware of any Advance Directives you may have provided to other family members, your doctor or the hospital. Introduce your advocate to your physician. This will assure that your wishes are carried out, should unexpected circumstances arise to which you cannot respond. 7. Prepare ahead for special family needs or personal support. Hospitalization can create crisis within a family depending on the severity of illness, length of stay, recovery, and the family situation. Children in single-parent homes may need a caretaker. Families on tight budgets may need financial support. Patients with life-changing illnesses may need emotional or spiritual support. Ask if your hospital has social workers, flexible financing arrangements, and counselors/clergy for your personal support. Will you need assistance when you are at home recovering? Many community organizations and home health services provide short-term assistance for patients needing home nursing therapy, meal preparation, transportation or help with personal hygiene. 8. Prepare for your hospital stay. Find out when to arrive, what you should bring with you and what instructions your doctor has regarding eating and drinking prior to admission. Ask about visiting hours and what times meals are served. Bring something to entertain you while you rest: reading materials, playing cards, crossword puzzles, etc. 9. Stay informed throughout the course of your treatment. Be familiar with your chart and know what medications you are taking, how often and why. Ask what medications your attending nurse is giving before you take them; don t take medications that haven t properly been explained to you, and don t sign papers you don t understand. Whenever you have questions, ask them, and make sure you get an answer that s clear. (More)NAIP/Guidelines for Patients Page 4 10. Follow your doctor s recovery recommendations. Don t shortchange yourself after you re discharged. Follow your doctor s recommendations. It s not uncommon for people who don t finish their prescribed medications, or don t stay in bed long enough, to end up back in the hospital. For more information on hospitalization, contact the National Association of Inpatient Physicians at 1-800-843-3360, or visit our web site at www.naiponline.org.","date":"12-14-2015","status":"great!"}]}]
